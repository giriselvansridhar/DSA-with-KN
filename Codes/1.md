# Key Terms in Python Syntax and Semantics

**Single line comments**
- Definition: Comments that occupy a single line, starting with `#`.
- Example:
  ```python
  # This is a single line comment
  ```

**Multiline comments**
- Definition: Comments that span multiple lines, usually enclosed in triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`).
- Example:
  ```python
  '''
  This is a multiline comment
  '''
  ```

**Syntax**
- Definition: The set of rules that defines the structure of valid statements in a programming language.
- Example:
  ```python
  print("Hello, World!")
  ```

**Semantics**
- Definition: The meaning or effect of a statement or block of code.
- Example:
  ```python
  x = 5  # The variable x is assigned the value 5
  ```

**Basic Syntax rules in python**
- Definition: Fundamental rules for writing valid Python code (indentation, case sensitivity, etc.).
- Example:
  ```python
  if True:
      print("Valid syntax")
  ```

**Indentation**
- Definition: Spaces or tabs at the beginning of a line to define code blocks.
- Example:
  ```python
  for i in range(3):
      print(i)
  ```

**Case Sensitivity**
- Definition: Python treats variables with different cases as different identifiers.
- Example:
  ```python
  name = "Alice"
  Name = "Bob"
  print(name, Name)  # Output: Alice Bob
  ```

**Line Continuation**
- Definition: Breaking a long statement into multiple lines using a backslash (`\`).
- Example:
  ```python
  total = 1 + 2 + 3 + \
          4 + 5
  ```

**Multiple Statements on a Single Line**
- Definition: Writing more than one statement on the same line using a semicolon (`;`).
- Example:
  ```python
  x = 1; y = 2; print(x + y)
  ```

**Variable Assignment**
- Definition: Assigning a value to a variable using the `=` operator.
- Example:
  ```python
  age = 25
  ```

**Type Inference**
- Definition: Python automatically determines the type of a variable based on the assigned value.
- Example:
  ```python
  x = 10      # int
  x = "ten"  # str
  ```

**Dynamic Typing**
- Definition: Variable types can change during program execution.
- Example:
  ```python
  var = 5
  var = "five"
  ```

**Name Error**
- Definition: Error raised when a variable is used before being defined.
- Example:
  ```python
  print(a)  # NameError: name 'a' is not defined
  ```

**IndentationError**
- Definition: Error raised when indentation is not consistent or correct.
- Example:
  ```python
  if True:
  print("Hello")  # IndentationError
  ```

**Practical Code Examples**
- Definition: Real code snippets that demonstrate concepts.
- Example:
  ```python
  for i in range(3):
      print("Example", i)
  ```
