# Terms Used in 2.variables.ipynb

1. **Variable**  
   A named storage for data that can be changed during program execution.

2. **Declaring and Assigning a Variable**  
   Creating a variable and giving it a value (e.g., `age = 32`).

3. **Naming Conventions**  
   Rules for naming variables (e.g., must start with a letter or underscore, case sensitive).

4. **Type Checking**  
   Determining the data type of a variable using `type()`.

5. **Type Conversion**  
   Changing a variable from one type to another (e.g., `str(age)`).

6. **Dynamic Typing**  
   Variables can change type during execution (e.g., `age = 25` then `age = "twenty-five"`).

7. **Input**  
   Getting user input using `input()`.

8. **Arithmetic Operations**  
   Performing calculations like addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

9. **Invalid Variable Name**  
   Variable names that do not follow naming conventions (e.g., `first-name`).

10. **Case Sensitivity**  
    Variable names with different cases are treated as different variables (e.g., `name` and `Name`).
